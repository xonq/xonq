## Microbe enthusiast and mushroom lover 🍄🦠

I am stoked about microbe genomics, evolutionary theory, and public health! Meet me at their confluence. 🌊

- 🔭 I’m currently working on automated viral genomics, *C. auris* epidemiological analysis, and rabies characterization.
- ⌚ I sometimes tinker with smart watch apps and climbing rocks 🧗‍♂️
